# IBM-Recommendation-System
My implementation of the IBM Recommendation System from Udacity DSND.

This Udacity project in collaboration with IBM involved building a recommendation system for articles on the IBM platform using 
Natural language Processing for content-based recommendations, user-article interactions for user-based
and Singular Value Decomposition collaborative filtering.

Using the recommendation system, users can be matched with articles.
